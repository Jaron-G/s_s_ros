I would like to use this repository to organize the notes I previously made, and it can also be used as a reference for future students.

## 0. Preliminary
> It is recommended to use `Docker` for testing and development of all `ROS` projects. This will greatly reduce the problems caused by environment configuration and improve work efficiency. Borrowing a phrase used for `python`:
> `Life is short, you need Docker`!

This repository provides a foolproof docker startup command, which is located in the [`./Docker`](Docker) directory. Read the [`README.md`](Docker/README.md) inside to learn how to use it.
